# Checkout Cart

A sample react project to recreate the Checkout Cart in E-commerce Website. This project demonstrates the components, nesting components, and use of React hook: `useReducer()` to manage the state of data, actions and render them into components. Data has been fetched from the API: [https://www.course-api.com/react-useReducer-cart-project](https://www.course-api.com/react-useReducer-cart-project) using react hook `useEffect()`.
